How to run code:

You must use the command line.
Format: python .\analysis_pcap_tcp.py <filename>
Example: python .\analysis_pcap_tcp.py assignment2.pcap

This is how I ran it on my machine, you might need to replace "python" with "python3".
If it somehow doesn't run, you can go into the code and replace 'sys.argv[1]' with "assignment2.pcap", then run.

The format of my output is self-explanatory and I also left a short sentence in the output to clarify my output. All
parts of this assignment should display properly.

I have a bug with my pycharm where sometimes the code is just cutoff during printing. It is not an issue with my code
but in the event that not everything prints out, just rerun the code and everything should be there. I did do every
thing in the assignment document.
